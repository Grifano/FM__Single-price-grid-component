### Continued development

I'm focusing on improving my programming skills with HTML&CSS and JavaScript. My plan is to get comfortable with the basics before I going to dive into the Frontend framework/library like React, Angular, Vue, etc.
I hope that such amzing tools like [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and [Uxcel](https://uxcel.com?invite=EE4PBID94EEH) help me with my this.
